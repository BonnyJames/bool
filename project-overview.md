## Core Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Content Management**: Outstatic CMS (Git-based)
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages
- **Media Storage**: Cloudflare R2
- **SEO**: Static generation with structured data

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Static Site with Intelligent Partial Builds

We've chosen a fully static site approach without a database to maximize performance, reliability, and cost efficiency. To manage the large volume of content (~40,000 articles) efficiently, we've implemented:

- **Content Organization by Priority**: 
  - High-priority content (homepage, featured articles)
  - Category landing pages
  - Recent articles (newest content)
  - Archived content (older articles)

- **Intelligent Build System**:
  - Git-based detection of changed content areas
  - Smart build script that determines build scope
  - Partial builds to update only affected pages
  - Periodic full rebuilds for complete site refresh

### 2. Content Management with Outstatic

Outstatic provides a modern, user-friendly CMS that stores content as markdown files in the GitHub repository. This approach offers:

- **Git-Based Version Control**: Full history of all content changes
- **Structured Content**: Defined schemas for articles, videos, and movies
- **Editorial Workflow**: Draft/publish states, scheduled publishing
- **Markdown Support**: Rich content with code syntax highlighting
- **Custom Fields**: SEO metadata, media embeds, taxonomies
- **API-Free Architecture**: No runtime API dependencies

### 3. Media Optimization with R2

All media assets (images, videos) are stored in Cloudflare R2 and served through a Next.js API route with:

- **Automatic Format Conversion**: WebP/AVIF for modern browsers
- **Responsive Sizing**: Multiple sizes based on viewport
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load images when needed
- **Blur Placeholders**: Improve perceived performance
- **Edge Delivery**: Served from Cloudflare's global network

## Content Workflow

### Content Creation & Publishing

1. **Author creates content** in Outstatic CMS
   - Writes article with markdown
   - Adds metadata (title, description, etc.)
   - Uploads images to R2
   - Tags with categories and keywords
   - Sets priority level (high/normal)

2. **Content is saved** as markdown in the GitHub repository
   - High-priority content goes to `/outstatic/content/high-priority/`
   - Recent articles go to `/outstatic/content/recent-articles/`
   - Older content is in `/outstatic/content/archive/`

3. **Build process is triggered**
   - Build script detects which content areas changed
   - Determines whether to do full or partial build
   - Generates only the necessary pages

4. **Content is published** to Cloudflare Pages
   - Static HTML files are deployed globally
   - Media assets are served from R2
   - CDN caching is applied for performance

### Content Archiving Process

To manage the large volume of content efficiently:

1. **Weekly automation** moves older content from `/recent-articles/` to `/archive/`
2. **Monthly full rebuild** ensures all content is properly generated
3. **Prioritization** ensures most viewed content is always pre-rendered

## Intelligent Build System

The intelligent build system is a key innovation in this project:

### Build Decision Logic

```javascript
// Simplified version of the build determination script
const changedFiles = getChangedFilesSinceLastBuild();

// Determine what type of content changed
const highPriorityChanged = changedFiles.some(file => 
  file.includes('/high-priority/') || 
  file.includes('/recent-articles/') ||
  file.includes('/categories/')
);

// Choose the appropriate build type
if (process.env.FULL_REBUILD === 'true') {
  runFullBuild();
} else if (highPriorityChanged) {
  runPriorityBuild();
} else {
  runMinimalBuild();
}
```

### Types of Builds

- **Full Build**: Generates all 40,000+ pages (~monthly)
- **Priority Build**: Only builds homepage, category pages, and recent articles (~daily)
- **Minimal Build**: Updates only specific changed pages (on-demand)

### Next.js Configuration

The Next.js configuration is tailored to support intelligent partial builds:

```javascript
// next.config.js (simplified)
module.exports = {
  // Generate different paths based on build type
  async generateStaticParams() {
    if (process.env.PRIORITY_ONLY === 'true') {
      return getHighPriorityPages();
    } else {
      return getAllPages();
    }
  },
  
  // Different revalidation times by content type
  async headers() {
    return [
      {
        source: '/recent-articles/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400',
          },
        ],
      },
      {
        source: '/archive/:path*',
        headers: [
          {
            key: 'Cache-Control',
            value: 'public, max-age=604800, stale-while-revalidate=2592000',
          },
        ],
      },
    ];
  },
}
```

## Cost Structure

The project is highly cost-efficient:

| Component | Monthly Cost | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| **Cloudflare Pages** | $0-20 | Free hosting, minimal build minutes |
| **R2 Storage** | $15-75 | Media storage (1-5TB) |
